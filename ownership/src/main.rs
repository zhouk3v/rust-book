    // The reason why values can be copied is that integers (and other stack allocated types) have a known size at compile time
    // Rust has a 'copy' trait for types (stack-allocated types), where if it's implemented, will trivially copy the data rather than move it, letting both variables assigned to the data still valid
    // 'Copy' is implemented in all scalar types in Rust (u64, i32, bool)
    // 'Copy' cannot be implemented on types with the 'drop' trait. The 'Drop' trait means that something more has to be done when the instance of the type goes out of scope (i.e. heap memory needs to be de-allocated)

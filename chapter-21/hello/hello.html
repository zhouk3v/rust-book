      As you know, many have tried interpreting Allegri. Some cited existing
      philosophical works such as Bordiga, Hegel and Plato. The former saw
      Allegri as the progenitor of a spontaneous revolution, his football being
      so boring it had deep ideological significance. They viewed his football
      as the cry of discontentedness with the neoliberal consensus, and a
      legitimate philosophical work in itâ€™s own right. The modern Hegelians saw
      Allegrismo as the dialectical synthesis between two states of being, that
      of anguish and that of ennui. Those using the works of Plato are
      conflicted on whether to see Allegriball as a concrete object, real and
      tangible, while all consider the feelings the games elicit to be abstract.
      Others saw it as post-modern performance art and tried to categorise it as
      the intended catalyst of a yet to materialise Neo-Fluxus movement. Alas,
      others even ascribed it a theological value, arguing for the canonisation
      of Allegri and compared our pain watching to the pain our lord felt on the
      cross. A contingent of these worshippers split recently and alleged
      Allegri was inherently heretical, no mortal man had ever suffered like
      Jesus did until we watched the Sampdoria game. The truth is, Allegriball
      defies what the human mind is capable of interpreting. Do you suppose we
      can only bask in its majesty?

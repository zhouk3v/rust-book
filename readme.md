An attempt to learn Rust from the book

Chapters with lots of code examples will be a cargo project, with notes in the comments

Chapters with not many code examples will instead contain markdown files with notes

Note that this repo serve as a complement to summarize/refresh important points of the book, and not intended as a replacement for the book

Remember that you can access an offline copy of the book via

```
rustup doc --book
```
